# Data Cleaning and Heart Disease Prediction

This repository contains notebooks for data cleaning and a machine learning model to predict heart disease. Follow the steps below to set up the environment and get started.

## Setup Environment - Anaconda

1. Create a new environment:
   ```bash
   conda create --name main-ds python=3.10
   ```
2. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate main-ds
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setup Environment - Shell/Terminal

1. Create a project directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir proyek_analisis_data
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd proyek_analisis_data
   ```
3. Use `pipenv` to set up the environment:
   ```bash
   pipenv install
   pipenv shell
   ```
4. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Notebooks Included

- **Data Cleaning.ipynb**: Handles preprocessing and cleaning of datasets.
- **Heart_Disease_Prediction_Model.ipynb**: Develops and evaluates a machine learning model to predict heart disease.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10
- Anaconda or Pipenv

## Usage

1. Set up the environment as described above.
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment.
3. Follow the steps in the notebooks to preprocess the data and train the model.
